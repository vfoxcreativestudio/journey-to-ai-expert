# 🚀 Journey to AI Expert

> Hi. My name is Viviane 🦊 and in this repository I will document my entire learning journey about AI: daily projects, messy code, real learning. Perfectionist learning to ship imperfect. Escaping course addiction, building real skills. Public commits, honest progress, zero BS.
